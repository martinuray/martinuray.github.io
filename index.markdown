I am a researcher and lecturer at the [Salzburg University of Applied Sciences (SUAS)](https://www.fh-salzburg.ac.at/en/){:target="_blank"}. Here I am a member of the [Applied Data Science Lab](https://its.fh-salzburg.ac.at/forschung/applied-data-science-lab/){:target="_blank"}. The courses to lecture are in the field of Signal Processing, Applied Mathematics, Machine Learning and Image Processing for the degree programs of [Information Technology & Systems Management](https://www.fh-salzburg.ac.at/en/study/engineering/information-technology-systems-management-master){:target="_blank"} (Bachelor- & Masters-Level) and [Applied Image & Signal Processing](https://aisp-salzburg.ac.at/){:target="_blank"} (Masters-level, Joint Master with the Paris-Lodron University Salzburg). Before SUAS, I spent 2 years as a researcher at [medPhoton](https://www.medphoton.at/){:target="_blank"}, working in the field of Medical Physics and Image Processing applying AI for image quality improvements for Cone-Beam CTs.

### Supervision of Theses

For requests on supervision for Bachelor- and Master Theses, please reach out to me via e-mail, stating your field of interest, a possible topic, or the company the internship is conducted at. Even if your idea of the topic is not that clear at the moment, still reach out to me if you are interested in working with me. The topic can be refined/adjusted together.

## Research

My current research is focused on artificial intelligence, machine learning and data science applied to the setting of industrial automation.

### Projects

Since 2022 I am part of _The Josef Ressel Center on Intelligent and Secure Industrial Automation (ISIA)_. This is a [CDG](https://www.cdg.ac.at/en/){:target="_blank"} funded research center at the Salzburg University of Applied Sciences headed by FH-Prof. Dr. Stefan Huber. It is dedicated to fundamental-driven applied research and expects scientific excellence.
