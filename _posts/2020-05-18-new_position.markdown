## Leaving *medPhoton*
I decided to leave medPhoton. My last day was March, 31st by submitting the last revision of the paper that was accepted recently (see post [here]({{ site.url }}/publications/2020/04/10/paper_acceptance_pmb.html)).

During the time with ~medPhoton~ I did learn a lot! I learned a lot of aspects in terms of research in industry, medical physics, medical imaging, but also a lot about certifications and quality management in the medical devices industry. I was part of the preparation and the execution of certifications and audits for the CE and the FDA. I learned a lot about fundings for research projects.

Since I still want to develop my career, I decided to leave ~medPhoton~ and to look for other adventures.


## Returning to SUAS
On from today, I am a researcher and lecturer at the [Salzburg University of Applied Sciences (SUAS)](https://www.fh-salzburg.ac.at/en/){:target="_blank"}. Here I am a member of the [Applied Data Science Lab](https://its.fh-salzburg.ac.at/forschung/applied-data-science-lab/){:target="_blank"}. The courses to lecture are in the field of Signal Processing, Applied Mathematics, Machine Learning and Image Processing for the degree programs of [Information Technology & Systems Management](https://www.fh-salzburg.ac.at/en/study/engineering/information-technology-systems-management-master){:target="_blank"} (Bachelor- & Masters-Level) and [Applied Image & Signal Processing](https://aisp-salzburg.ac.at/){:target="_blank"} (Masters-level, Joint Master with the Paris-Lodron University Salzburg).

My field of research will include the fields of Natural Language Processing, Image Processing, and Deep Learning. Here I will start to work (again) in the team of  [Stefan Wegenkittl](https://its.fh-salzburg.ac.at/ueber-uns/leitung/detail/wegenkittl-stefan/), who already supervised my masters thesis.

Happy to be back!!!
